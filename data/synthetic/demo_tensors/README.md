# Demo Tensors Dataset

## Dataset Card

- **Name**: Demo Tensors
- **Description**: A small synthetic dataset of NumPy tensors generated with `scripts/generate_tensors.py`, stored in HDF5 format (`.h5`). Intended for demonstration purposes and showcasing tensors of various dimensions.
- **Source**: Generated by `scripts/generate_tensors.py` using `numpy.random.rand`, `numpy.array`, and saved with `h5py`.
- **License**: Refer to the main LICENSE file in the repository.
- **Structure**: Contains an HDF5 file (`demo_tensors.h5`) with the following datasets:
    - `tensor_a`: shape `(100, 3)` - A general 2D tensor.
    - `tensor_b`: shape `(50, 10, 3)` - A general 3D tensor.
    - `scalar_data`: A 0D tensor (scalar).
    - `vector_data`: A 1D tensor of shape `(150,)`.
    - `image_grayscale_data`: A 2D tensor of shape `(32, 32)`, representing a grayscale image.
    - `image_rgb_data`: A 3D tensor of shape `(16, 16, 3)`, representing an RGB image.
    - `video_frames_data`: A 4D tensor of shape `(10, 8, 8, 1)`, representing a sequence of grayscale frames.
    - `simulation_data`: A 5D tensor of shape `(5, 6, 6, 3, 2)`, representing higher-dimensional data.
- **Generation Steps**:
    1. Navigate to the root of the repository.
    2. Run the command: `python scripts/generate_tensors.py data/synthetic/demo_tensors`
    3. This will create/overwrite `data/synthetic/demo_tensors/demo_tensors.h5` with all the listed tensors.

## Setup and Usage

Before using the dataset or running the associated demo notebook, ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. Navigate to the root of this repository and run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This file includes libraries like `numpy` and `h5py` which are needed to generate and interact with the `demo_tensors.h5` file.

### Loading and Inspecting Data

```python
import h5py
import numpy as np # Still useful for array operations

# Define the path to the data file.
# This file is typically generated in the data/synthetic/demo_tensors/ directory.
# If running from repository root:
# data_file_path = 'data/synthetic/demo_tensors/demo_tensors.h5'
# If running from notebooks/ (like in the demo notebook):
data_file_path = '../data/synthetic/demo_tensors/demo_tensors.h5' # Adjust path as needed

with h5py.File(data_file_path, 'r') as hf:
    # List all datasets (tensors) in the file
    print(f"Available datasets: {list(hf.keys())}")

    # Access specific datasets
    # Use [:] to load the full dataset into a NumPy array
    tensor_a = hf['tensor_a'][:]
    image_rgb = hf['image_rgb_data'][:]

    # For scalar datasets, use [()] to get the scalar value
    scalar_value = hf['scalar_data'][()]
    # Alternatively, convert to a NumPy array first:
    # scalar_as_array = np.array(hf['scalar_data'])

    print(f"Shape of tensor_a: {tensor_a.shape}, dtype: {tensor_a.dtype}")
    print(f"Shape of image_rgb: {image_rgb.shape}, dtype: {image_rgb.dtype}")
    print(f"Value of scalar_data: {scalar_value}, type: {type(scalar_value)}")

    # Example: Accessing another tensor
    vector_data = hf['vector_data'][:]
    print(f"Shape of vector_data: {vector_data.shape}")

    # You can iterate through all datasets like this:
    print("\\n--- All datasets and their shapes ---")
    for name in hf.keys():
        # For HDF5 datasets, .shape is available directly,
        # and .dtype as well.
        print(f"Dataset: '{name}', Shape: {hf[name].shape}, Dtype: {hf[name].dtype}")
        if name == 'scalar_data':
            print(f"  Scalar Value: {hf[name][()]}")
```
The `demo_tensors.h5` file contains a diverse set of tensors, including 0D (scalar), 1D (vector), 2D (e.g., grayscale image), 3D (e.g., RGB image), 4D (e.g., video frames), and 5D tensors. You can access any of them by using their key (dataset name). Refer to the "Structure" section for a full list of available tensor names.
