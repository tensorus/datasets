# Demo Tensors Dataset

## Dataset Card

- **Name**: Demo Tensors
- **Description**: A small synthetic dataset of NumPy tensors generated with `scripts/generate_tensors.py`. Intended for demonstration purposes and showcasing tensors of various dimensions.
- **Source**: Generated by `scripts/generate_tensors.py` using `numpy.random.rand` and `numpy.array`.
- **License**: Refer to the main LICENSE file in the repository.
- **Structure**: Contains a compressed NumPy `.npz` file (`demo_tensors.npz`) with the following tensors:
    - `tensor_a`: shape `(100, 3)` - A general 2D tensor.
    - `tensor_b`: shape `(50, 10, 3)` - A general 3D tensor.
    - `scalar_data`: A 0D tensor (scalar).
    - `vector_data`: A 1D tensor of shape `(150,)`.
    - `image_grayscale_data`: A 2D tensor of shape `(32, 32)`, representing a grayscale image.
    - `image_rgb_data`: A 3D tensor of shape `(16, 16, 3)`, representing an RGB image.
    - `video_frames_data`: A 4D tensor of shape `(10, 8, 8, 1)`, representing a sequence of grayscale frames.
    - `simulation_data`: A 5D tensor of shape `(5, 6, 6, 3, 2)`, representing higher-dimensional data.
- **Generation Steps**:
    1. Navigate to the root of the repository.
    2. Run the command: `python scripts/generate_tensors.py data/synthetic/demo_tensors`
    3. This will create/overwrite `data/synthetic/demo_tensors/demo_tensors.npz` with all the listed tensors.

## Usage

```python
import numpy as np

# Load the data
# This file is typically generated in the data/synthetic/demo_tensors/ directory
# If running from repository root:
# data_file_path = 'data/synthetic/demo_tensors/demo_tensors.npz'
# If running from notebooks/ (like in the demo notebook):
data_file_path = '../data/synthetic/demo_tensors/demo_tensors.npz'

data = np.load(data_file_path)

# Access the tensors (examples)
tensor_a = data['tensor_a']
tensor_b = data['tensor_b']
scalar = data['scalar_data']
image_rgb = data['image_rgb_data']
# ... and so on for all other tensors listed in the Structure section.

# Check shapes (examples)
print(f"Tensor A shape: {tensor_a.shape}")
print(f"Scalar value: {scalar} (shape: {scalar.shape})")
print(f"All available tensors: {sorted(list(data.files))}")

# To see all tensors and their shapes:
# for tensor_name in data.files:
#     print(f"Tensor: {tensor_name}, Shape: {data[tensor_name].shape}")
```
The `demo_tensors.npz` file now contains a more diverse set of tensors, including 0D (scalar), 1D (vector), 2D (e.g., grayscale image), 3D (e.g., RGB image), 4D (e.g., video frames), and 5D tensors. You can access any of them by using their key (e.g., `data['scalar_data']`, `data['vector_data']`, etc.). Refer to the "Structure" section for a full list of available tensor names.
